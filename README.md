# nand2tetris
Building a general purpose computer all the way up from a simple nAND gate.

Roughly following the nand2tetris website but from scratch, without the provided software tools. 

The starting nAND gate is a Python class with a simple if statement.

## Part I: Boolean logic
nAND -> elementary gates

Time scale:
- Theory: 1h 30min
- Implementation: 3h 30min

## Part II: Boolean arithmatic
Using elementary gates to create an ALU, capable of performing the most necessary elementary operations.

Time scale:
- Theory: 50min
- Implementation: 2h 30min
